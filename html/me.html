            <div class="about">
                <p>
                    I'm a student of Singapore Polytechnic studying for a diploma in Information Technology (programming, app design, <i>working with other people</i>, data analysis and storytelling).
                    I also have quite a number of hobbies, my efforts and ideas being showcased on this website, and I'm always eager to meet new people whom I can collaborate with.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="about">
                <p>
                    I had also wanted to be a content creator since childhood, which resulted in me sometimes acting out scenes I have in my imagination (i.e. talking to nobody), but it's probably okay if you express curiosity about what I'm saying.
                    And I still would like to be a part of social media, but now my attitude has changed and I would rather be a host or an editor - some part of production - on a larger team - working with friends.

            <h3>Who is This Dog That Appears On All My Socials?</h3>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>
                            This is Khroma, the identity I use online in order to maintain anonymity. In the same way most people identify their username or avatar as themself, I also intended Khroma to just be "me as an anonymous internet user, or as a fictional character if I'm not acting in person", rather than his own character that is completely separated from me.
                            As such, I'm having a hard time deciding whether to refer to Khroma in the first person, or the third person. (For now, he will be referred to with third person pronouns)
                        </p>

                            <p>Reference art of Khroma if you'd like to draw him!</p>
                        </dl>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>


            <h4>Interested in Making Art of Him?</h4>
            <p>First of all, thanks for the offer! But importantly, please tell me about it at some point, which you can do by emailing me (<a href="mailto:brandongwee.contact@gmail.com" target="_blank">brandongwee.contact@gmail.com</a>) because I still associate this character very strongly with myself and it would be weird if he strayed too far from that, thanks for understanding.</p>

            
            <h5>Important traits of the character</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Khroma's appearance and anatomy is based off of dogs (I'm Singaporean Chinese, it's my zodiac), and lion dancers, so he literally has 4 legs 
                    <a href="https://kylehallnationaltrust.weebly.com/part-3---animation-production/-differences-similarities-human-animal-anatomy" target="_blank">(whereas real-world dogs' forelimbs are more like human hands than human legs)</a>,
                    and his chest is as far from the top of his head as his waist is from his chest.
                </li>

                <li>
                    He can change the colour of his fur and "eyes", but he has to guess where the colours go.
                </li>

                <li>
                    His "eyes" are actually lenses like goggles, and some extreme expressions may reveal his/my real eyes behind them. Though he does use the lenses like eyes, the "white shine" being his pupils.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Personality wise, he is just me and his mannerisms and motivations are the same as mine.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Khroma's fur is prehensile, and he likes to change his fur-style along with his colour. He might also use the fur on his belly as hands if he really needs them, but he prefers to use his upper legs first.
                </li>
            </ul>

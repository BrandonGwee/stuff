            <div class="about">
                <p>
                    I'm a student of Singapore Polytechnic studying for a diploma in Information Technology (programming, app design, <i>working with other people</i>, data analysis and storytelling).
                    I also have quite a number of hobbies, my efforts and ideas being showcased on this website, and I'm always eager to meet new people whom I can collaborate with.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="about">
                <p>
                    I had also wanted to be a content creator since childhood, which resulted in me sometimes acting out scenes I have in my imagination (read: talking to nobody), but it's probably okay if you express curiosity about what I'm saying.
                    And I still would like to be a part of social media, but now my attitude has changed and I would rather be a host or an editor - some part of production - on a larger team - working with friends.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="about">
                <p>
                    I would say, that the current long term <i>overarching goal</i> I have for my career is to forge more long term relationships with others and create experiences that most people can just enjoy, but also gives those people the permission to think critically about those works and the messages they might be trying to say.

                            This is Khroma, the representation of me for (originally) maintaining anonymity online, more of costume I wear than a "mascot" with his own identity.
                        </p>

            <h4>Interested in Making Art of Me?</h4>
            <p>First of all, thanks for the offer! But importantly, please tell me about it at some point, which you can do by emailing me (<a href="mailto:brandongwee.contact@gmail.com" target="_blank">brandongwee.contact@gmail.com</a>) because I still associate this character very strongly with myself and it would be weird if he strayed too far from that, thanks for understanding.</p>

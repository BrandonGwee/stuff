        <p>Right now these might just be the core concept, or being written, or even published. I will update this page depending on the case.</p>
        <p>I'm also eager to make new friends whom I can work on these projects with.</p>

                <h6>Summary:</h6>
                <p>An episodic blog about a duo of data scientists and their two assistants tackling problems around the city, sometimes having to deal with members of a conspiracy going against the government. They reveal the complexities of decision making in the real practical world, and inadvertently learn about A.I. safety along the way.</p>

                <h6>Summary:</h6>
                <p>The Placebo Plaza is an extradimensional plane where the beliefs and imaginations of it's inhabitants - conscious or subconcious - are made true, inhabitants who can freely enter or exit from the real world through a gateway object of their choice as an avatar of their creation. This episodic animated web series explores what happens when reality seeps into escapism, it's a comedy, it's a drama, it's a psychological horror.</p>

                <h3>( The Tragedy of ) a Mind Exposed</h3>
                <h6>Summary:</h6>
                <p>An exploration of both extremes of the Dunning-Kruger effect. Our protagonist starts out as cocky and naive, always thinking that their way of doing things at least works well enough for them, to everyone else's disappointment. At some point they learn to listen to what others can teach them, and they becomes more receptive to help. This however turns into not trusting their own judgement and belief that everyone else knows better than them about everything. In the finale, they try to wrestle back control and assert their cofidence and competence...    in a task they have no experience in, which costs them their life.</p>

                <h6>Summary:</h6>
                <p>A live-action serialised show which recounts a slightly obscure historical event. That's the first season. Every season gets more and more meta from there. Example: The second season is the behind-the-scenes making of the show, then season three follows 2 friends watching season 2 of the show, noticing that a few of the details don't make sense, before they go on an adventure to investigate the true history that the show had misrepresented.</p>

                <h3>Will You be Bamboozled??</h3>
                <h6>Summary:</h6>
                <p>A classic "general knowledge" trivia show, but with a twist: some of the questions are outright impossible (or at least requires infinite time to fully answer), which contestants will have to opt out from.
                    Scoring goes as follows: a point for a correct answer or correct opt out, no points for a wrong answer, and you <i>lose</i> a point for opting out of a question with a correct answer, and also for trying to answer an impossible question.
                    The main draw of the show will be watching (however many) contestants floundering as they cautiously opt out of possible questions and impulsively answer impossible ones.

                <p>A series of short-form sketches that revolve around a pun, translated into English and another language (Chinese in this case), in such a way that the joke is roughly the same (e.g. "night" and "knight"; “晚” and “碗”)</p>

                <p>In a world much like our own, a person's fate in death is determined by the current Zeitgeist, the general beliefs and values of the population at the time.
                    Would society think a person like you deserved paradise? Or damnation?
                    Would you rather conform to the Zeigeist, or push for revolution in a bid to create a new one?

                <h3>The Cassandra Show</h3>
                <h6>Summary:</h6>
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra" target="_blank">Cassandra of Troy</a> was given the gift of prophecy by a god but because of... <i>romantic reasons</i> she was cursed so that none believed them, in spite of their truth.
                    This series would attempt to replicate the feeling in the (real-life) audience, by writing a show so incomprehensible that not even multiple people in the same room would be able to describe it to each other, explanations ideally dissloving into fits of laughter and incoherent stammering.

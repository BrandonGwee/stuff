                <h6>Summary:</h6>
                <p>The Placebo Plaza is an extradimensional plane where the beliefs and imaginations of it's inhabitants - conscious or subconcious - are made true, inhabitants who can freely enter or exit from the real world through a gateway object of their choice as an avatar of their creation. This episodic animated web series explores what happens in a realm where everyone is God, the characters also confront their nightmares from the real world; now more vivid than ever; and the Plaza helps some characters realise even more nightmares.</p>

                <h3>( The Tragedy of ) a Mind Exposed</h3>
                <h6>Summary:</h6>
                <p>An exploration of both extremes of the Dunning-Kruger effect. Our protagonist starts out as cocky and naive, always thinking that their way of doing things at least works well enough for them, to everyone else's disappointment. At some point they learn to listen to what others can teach them, and they becomes more receptive to help. This however turns into not trusting their own judgement and belief that everyone else knows better than them about everything. In the finale, they try to wrestle back control and assert their cofidence and competence...    in a task they have no experience in, which costs them their life.</p>
